# The World's Greatest Child Entertainers

There’s nothing quite as important as ensuring you’re punctual for any and all appointments made. This is a sign of respect and concern for the other parties time and needs. No being understands this quite as well as a clown. Your task, should you be so inclined, is to build a Django application, specifically for the time management needs of this world’s greatest child entertainers. The application, when complete, should be able to allow clowns, troupe leaders and clients to:

### Authenticate themselves as clowns, troupe leaders or clients

#### Clients to:
 - View their upcoming and past appointments (as an API endpoint)
 - Rate a past appointment with clown face emojis

#### Troupe leaders to:
 - Create appointments for clowns, assigned to a limited capacity troupe, managed by themselves

#### Clowns to:
 - View their appointments and change the current status of these appointments (upcoming, incipient, completed, canceled)
 - Report an issue with an appointment (not a state change)
 - Request client contact details, with the reason for the request
